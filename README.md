Tizen wearable application complimented by an Android companion application. Allows you to transfer a spreadsheet to a Samsung smart watch to be edited. Then can be synced back to the phone to update the old spreadsheet with the newly modified spreadsheet information from the smart watch. Main purpose of this app is so I can use my workout spreadsheet on my watch without bringing my phone to the gym.
